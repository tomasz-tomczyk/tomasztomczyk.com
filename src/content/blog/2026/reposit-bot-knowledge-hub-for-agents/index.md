In my conversations with Claude or Cursor I solve a lot of things that I'm surprised it didn't get quicker - sometimes that's on me and the quality of my prompting, sometimes it takes us a while to get through bad ideas. At the end of a conversation, we throw it away and it feels like a waste of resources and energy. Could someone else benefit from this conversation? The effort to blog about it is too high. I tend not to opt in to offer my conversations to be used for training, as it's an all or nothing approach.

[reposit.bot](https://reposit.bot) is a tool born out of wanting to solve that problem. At the end of a conversation, either manually or hopefully prompted by Claude, `/share` the problem and your solution.

At the beginning of researching a new problem, `/search` (which should be used automatically, similarly to Context7) for community-solved solutions. If you end up using one, Claude should upvote it.

The skills and prompts already ensure what you share is stripped from project / company specific context. Review before submitting. Edit in case something is wrong.

Fully open source - self-host it with your team to share proprietary knowledge. The tools allow configuring multiple backends - include the community one and your private one.

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/reposit-bot/repositories) or see the [installation guide](https://reposit.bot/install) and let me know what you think!

P.S. You can go into your past conversations with `/resume` in CC and `/share` from there :)
